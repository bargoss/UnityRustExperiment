----    -   move the rollback controller from c# to here
----    -   a partial rollback demo is needed after rollback controller is done
----    -   static objects in physics world
----    -   ecs world needed
----    -   physics system needed
----    -   collider without velocity needs to be treated as a "static" collider, it won't move during collisions

----    -   figure out what to do when a player takes too long to send an input
            options are:
            -   stop the time and wait for the player (easiest option)
            -   stop the game (not a good idea for more than two players)
            -   just have a server (backend complexity)
            -   make a p2p consensus system (learn valuable stuff)
                that gives us synced info on which players have become inactive in which tick
                so all the other peers know when a players inputs are invalidated and the game will will continue without them
