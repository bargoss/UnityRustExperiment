Example world state:
    -tank bubble entities
    -tank entities
    -beam entities


update cycle:
    sample inputs

    if agreed state can progress:
        rollback prediction enabled entity states
        simulate the world until the last tick where all inputs are known
        save prediction enabled entity states


    advance the world with a filter on the prediction enabled entities
    if(current (predicted) tick > agreed tick):
        register keyframes in interpolation buffers
