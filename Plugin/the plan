tasks:
    make it more easily testable:
        id based referencing instead of entity based
            id <-> entity dictionaries and all bubble creation/destructions use that
        cleanup the initialization system
            add functions
                add bubble (returns bubble id)
                remove bubble (removes bubble with id)
                    the beam related systems will take care of missing references
                remove all bubbles

PointNeighbourship:
    duration: frames it has been around,
    duration_needed: frames it has to be around to have an effect,

beam management system:
    create or increment beams that are close
